		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Greetings, my name is Kamron Dillon and I’m a returning student after 10+ years of absence. The reason I dropped out of college was the feeling of disconnection between what I was being taught and what real world skills I wanted. I was flustered by the education requirements of the profession I wanted to enter. It was like being forced to buy something you don’t want, just to get what you do want. It’s amazing how a decade can change your perception of the world. I used to fear classes like this one, because I would come in with near zero knowledge on the subject. Now instead of fear I feel a sense of adventure. </p>

		<h1>When I have free time</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Volunteer at my church</li>
			<li>Stay active in sports like basketball</li>
			<li>Watch YouTube videos from historian UCLA Eugen Weber; OMG I never knew just how much Americans are like the ancient Greeks!</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>My favorite web site is<a href="https://youtu.be/6lrcdSM6p5g?t=23">YouTube</a>, specifically the channel “The Western Tradition – Eugen Weber”.<br>
		I dare you to listen to just 30 seconds of historian Eugen Weber (UCLA) <a href="https://youtu.be/6lrcdSM6p5g?t=23">YouTube clip (The Rise of Greek Civilization)</a> and tell me you are NOT HOOKED on this man.
